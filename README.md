# Worderly - online multiplayer game

Worderly was the capstone project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The goal of this online game is to construct a word by its definition using all given letters faster than your opponent. I've faced a lot of challenges while working on this project e.g. implementing MVP pattern, working with Firebase, building Content Providers with Loaders, and for networking using Volley with GSON.
